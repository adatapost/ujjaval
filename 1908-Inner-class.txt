Inner class - static modifier will create another top-level like class that is just placed inside another class but it is not a member of that class.


class School {
    private String name, address;

    // static classes - are not members of enclosing class. It is the class that
    // is created inside it.

    public static class Student { }
    public static class Staff { }
}


// Test methods

 School.Student s1 = new School.Student(1,"A");
 School.Staff s2 = new School.Staff(2,"AA");

 School sc = new School();
 sc.setName("ABC School");
